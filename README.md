"DESCRIPTION":
API integration in a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows the app to fetch and display real-time weather data from an external source, such as the OpenWeatherMap API.

When a user enters a city name in the input field (HTML), JavaScript captures the input and sends a fetch() request to the weather API URL using a valid API key. The API responds with weather information like temperature, humidity, description, and wind speed in JSON format. JavaScript then extracts this data and updates the webpage dynamically. CSS is used to style the page, making the UI clean and responsive.

Core steps:

HTML: Builds the structure – input field, button, and display areas.

CSS: Styles the layout and weather info.

JavaScript: Handles API calls, fetches data, and updates the DOM.

API Key: Authenticates the app’s requests to the weather service.

This integration enables users to get live weather updates quickly and interactively.
